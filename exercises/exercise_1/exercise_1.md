# Exercise 1 - Data transformations

In this exercise, you get to familiarize yourself with SQL.

> [!NOTE]
> To ingest data to the database, you should use CLI in combination with SQL script

> [!NOTE]
> Try not to skip those tasks which are more free, where you need to think what else that could be explored, transformed etc. These are very important as in industry it's common that you need to explore data and participate in stakeholders and team discussions.

## 0. Transform salaries data

For this task you should use the same salaries data as in lecture 04 and 05. Create a new table that should contain the transformed data and call the table cleaned_salaries.

&nbsp; a) Transform employment type column based on this table

| abbreviation | meaning   |
| ------------ | --------- |
| CT           | Contract  |
| FL           | Freelance |
| PT           | Part time |
| FT           | Full time |

&nbsp; b) Do similar for company size, but you have to figure out what the abbreviations could stand for.

&nbsp; c) Make a salary column with Swedish currency for yearly salary.

&nbsp; d) Make a salary column with Swedish currency for monthly salary.

&nbsp; e) Make a salary_level column with the following categories: low, medium, high, insanely_high. Decide your thresholds for each category. Make it base on the monthly salary in SEK.

&nbsp; f) Choose the following columns to include in your table: experience_level, employment_type, job_title, salary_annual_sek, salary_monthly_sek, remote_ratio, company_size, salary_level

&nbsp; g) Think of other transformation that you want to do.

## 1. Explore your transformed table

&nbsp; a) Count number of Data engineers jobs. For simplicity just go for job_title Data Engineer.

&nbsp; b) Count number of unique job titles in total.

&nbsp; c) Find out how many jobs that goes into each salary level.

&nbsp; d) Find out the median and mean salaries for each seniority levels.

&nbsp; e) Find out the top earning job titles based on their median salaries and how much they earn.

&nbsp; f) How many percentage of the jobs are fully remote, 50 percent remote and fully not remote.

&nbsp; g) Pick out a job title of interest and figure out if company size affects the salary. Make a simple analysis as a comprehensive one requires causality investigations which are much harder to find.

&nbsp; h) Feel free to explore other things

## 2. Theory questions

These study questions are good to get an overview of how SQL and relational databases work.

&nbsp; a) What are the main categories of SQL commands?
DDL - Data Definition Language
DML - Data Manipulation Language
DCL - Data Control Language
TCL - Transaction Control Language


&nbsp; b) Explain the difference between HAVING and WHERE clauses?
WHERE: filters rows before grouping 
HAVING: filters groups after aggregation used wehn GROUP BY is present

&nbsp; c) How to make sure you delete the correct rows?
You always SELECT first to make sure you delete the correct thing

&nbsp; d) How do you retrieve unique values in a column?
you use DISTINCT to retrieve unique values

&nbsp; e) What does data transformation mean?
e.g when you want the salary in sek but the table has it in USD, you need to transform it.

&nbsp; f) How do you create a new row in a table?
INSERT INTO table(column1, column2)
VALUES ('newdata', 69);

&nbsp; g) What happens if you omit the WHERE clause in an UPDATE statement?
if you dont use WHERE you will update all rows in the table

&nbsp; h) What happens if you omit the WHERE clause in a DELETE statement?
Then you will delete all rows in the table

&nbsp; i) What is a conditional statement in SQL, and can it be used with SELECT?

## Glossary

Fill in this table either by copying this into your own markdown file or copy it into a spreadsheet if you feel that is easier to work with.
